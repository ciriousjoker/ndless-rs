This crate is designed to store static, program-wide data for Ndless for
the TI-Nspire. This crate exists because Rust will use multiple crates
if their versions are incompatible. This crate should have a constant
major version number, so that programs will always work. You
probably don't want to use this crate directlyâ€”check out [ndless]
instead.
